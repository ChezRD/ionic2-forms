# Ionic 2 Forms Example

The documented examples here are simple, the kind I wished to have come across on the web during my early days with Ionic 2 forms.

Understanding the basics are crucial in every tool. Many tutorials and blogs online took Ionic 2 forms (and Angularjs 2 forms in general) in a relatively complex manner which made it way too harder for someone like myself to come to terms with the shift.

I put what I learn here to help myself now and for future projects, plus, perhaps, assist incoming ionic 2 ionizers to get up and running in the most basic way, but offering them the best of understanding with a solid basic background in forms, enough to let them go out there, power on the Hadron Collider, and get some particles Ionized!

## Examples available here
 - See how to create basic form in Ionic 2, using `ngForm`, `ngControl` and `ControlGroup` implicitly
 - How to use `FormBuilder` to explicitly create a form, with `Validators` and other customizations
